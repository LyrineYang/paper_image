The turntable begins to rotate at a constant angular velocity, causing the tennis ball to spin. As the real ball rotates, its virtual image in the mirror rotates in perfect synchrony. This provides a clear demonstration of uniform circular motion and the laws of plane mirror reflection, showing the smiley face disappearing and reappearing on both the object and its image simultaneously.",

The water-filled glass functions as a thick cylindrical lens, causing the light from the pattern to refract as it passes through.

The effect visually transforms the vertical wavy lines into a pattern of serpentine curves.",
